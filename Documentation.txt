Project 2: HTML Game

I am using Canvas, ES6 Classes, ES6 Modules, and ES6->ES5 Transpiling for my technology stack.

To fulfill the media requirment, I have a background sound that loops, there are various effect sounds in the game, and the sound files are kept at a small size.
I did not use the sounds provided in class. For images, I have PNGs that are used with a consistent theme, and text is readable with images drawn on the canvas with
canvas capabilities used.

To fulfill the interaction requirment, player can use the mouse in order to interact with the sprites on the screen. My controls are easy, and responsive, with
scenes changes and cut scenes between each level.

To fulfill usability requirment, I have instructions provided before each level, and the levels are relatively balanced. The game contains a title screen, with five levels,
two different end screens, and a variety of end level screens in between each level. I also included my name on the title screen.

To fulfill the game design requirment, I have met my plan of making an advanced Cage Clicker by changing the game completely and adding a lot more depth and story
instead of just player clicking on the game. There is a win and lose condiition, the player choices matter in a way that it gives them two different endings depending
on how well they do in the game, and the game has a storyline and my sprites are all made by me.

To fulfill the coding requirment, I used the howlerjs, used one of the tech stack and met the requirments, all JS code use object literals, preload images,
use module patterns, and it is all well commented.

If I had more time, I would like to add animations to the cut scenes, as well as a better UI for the title screen.

I believe this project should be graded 95.
